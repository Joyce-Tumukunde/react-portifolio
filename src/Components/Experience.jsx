          At Technica, I worked as a UI/UX Designer, where I was responsible for 
          creating user-centered designs for two major internal platforms using Figma. 
          The first project, a Kids Management Platform, focused on helping educators and 
          caregivers monitor children's talents, interests, and health data. The goal was 
          to provide a holistic overview of each childâ€™s development and potential.
          The second project was an HR Management System designed to streamline employee data 
          management and improve operational efficiency for HR teams. I was involved in end-to-end 
          design, from user research and wireframing to high-fidelity prototyping, while collaborating 
          with developers and stakeholders to ensure seamless implementation.

          As a trainee at SheCanCode, I had the opportunity to work on various projects, 
          both in Figma for UI/UX design and in React for front-end development. During 
          this period, I actively contributed as a Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer, 
          gaining hands-on experience in building user interfaces, designing user-centered 
          experiences, and developing responsive, interactive web applications.
